# Welcome to Marly's Math Dash!
### Made March 3rd 2025 by Miles Butler

## Overview:
Made using Python's built in tkinter package, Marly's Math Dash is an elementery level  
math game designed to allow students to challenge them selves in a fun, educational way.   

## Instructions: 
###   menu:
Using the program is simple. To play the game, all you have to do is double click the project file  
named "Marly's_Math_Dash" (assuming you have installed a python interpreter, which is required to  
run the program) Once in the game, you can click 'QUIT' to close the whole program, 'Leaderboard'    
to open a local leaderboard (more on that later), or "START" to start playing the game. 

### Game Screen:
Once the words "Go!" appear on the screen, the game has started. The goal of the game is    
to accumulate as many points as possible within the 120 seconds of allotted time by answering  
the red randomized questions correctly. To answer a question, simply type your answer into the  
white entry field and press enter. Once the timer reaches 0, the game will end and a game over screen will  
appear. Lastly, you can go from the game screen to the menu screen at any time by pressing the menu button.

### Game Over Screen:
In the game over screen, the user will be shown the final number of questions answered and their final  
score. When applicable, this screen is intended to be shown to a teacher or friend who may record and  
rank the scores using the leaderboard screen.

### Leaderboards:
The idea of the leaderboard system was to allow teachers or friend groups to create competitions that may  
last one or several days. One person would act as the host, adding everyones scores to their own local leaderboard  
file. Then, through other means, this scoreboard can be displayed to the class  to show who's in the lead.   
To access leader boards, simply press the leaderboard button in the menu. This should open a new window  
above the main one. To add or remove a score, go to the project folder and open the 'ADD_SCORES_HERE.txt' file.  
Then, on a new line, Add in the supposed users name/nickname, a colon, a space, and then that users score. Adding  
multiple scores would look like this in the txt file:             
  
"""  
Johnathan Giovanna: 93  
Walter White: 237  
John Arbuckle: 75
Joe: 82  
"""  

Because the program sorts the scores automatically, these scores do not have to be in order,  
and it's ok to have multiple scores from the same person.     

### Exiting:
To close both windows of the program, just navigate to the menu   
screen of the main window and press the "QUIT" button.
